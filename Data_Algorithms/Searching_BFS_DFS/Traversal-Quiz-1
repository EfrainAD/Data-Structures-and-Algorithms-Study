// Traversal-Quiz-1

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
     BFS
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
     BFS (DFS will take longer, though BFS uses more memory. So debatable answer.)
//If the tree is very wide:
     DFS (BFS Use up to mjuch memory)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
     DFS (Hopefully quicker)
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
     DFS (What it is built for.)
//Finding the shortest path
     BFS
